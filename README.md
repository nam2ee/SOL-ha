# solana-validator-ha

A gossip-based high availability (HA) manager for Solana validators. This tool helps automate *unexpected* failovers due to `<insert one of endless reasons>`. To automate *planned* failovers, see [solana-validator-failover](https://github.com/SOL-Strategies/solana-validator-failover)

![solana-validator-ha](demo/e2e/preview.png)

## Demo

Automatic failover resulting from loss of `active (voting)` leader.

**`primary (active)`** disconnects and is ensured to be `passive`

![primary-lost](demo/e2e/primary.gif)

**`backup (passive)`** detects loss of leader and becomes `active`

![backup-active](demo/e2e/backup.gif)

## Features

- **🔍 Intelligent Peer Detection**: Automatically detects validator roles based on network gossip and RPC identity
- **🛡️ Self-Healing**: Validators transition between active/passive roles based on health and network visibility
- **🪝 Hooks**: Pre/Post failover hook support for role transitions
- **📊 Prometheus Metrics**: Rich metrics collection for monitoring and alerting
- **🏁 First-Responder Failover**: Race-based failover where fastest healthy, passive validator assumes active role when the cluster is leaderless

### Conceptual overview

`solana-validator-ha` aims to provide a simple, low-dependency HA solution to running 2 or more related validators where one of these should be an `active (voting)` leader with the others remaining `passive (non-voting)`. The set of validators each have a unique `passive` identity and a shared `active` identity. The program discovers validators' HA peers using the existing gossip protocol and each peer makes independent failover decisions when no active peer is discovered.

To give the best chance of success when things turn to 💩 two (‼️**VERY**‼️) important user-supplied configuration settings are required:

#### 1. 🟢 Active command

A command to run for a node to assume the `active` role. This is simply a reference to a user-supplied command that will be called on the current node when a failover is required and:

  1. The node is healthy (so that it can take over as leader);
  1. The node is discoverable and reachable on its gossip-advertised port; and
  3. No other peers have already assumed the `active` role. 
   
   ```yaml
      # solana-validator-ha-config.yaml
      #...
      failover:
       active:
         command: "set-identity-with-rollback.sh" # user-supplied command -everyone's setup is different :-)
         args: [
           "--to-identity-file", "{{ .PassiveIdentityKeypairFile }}",
           "--rollback-identity-file", "{{ .PassiveIdentityKeypairFile }}",
         ]
      #...
   ```

#### 2. 🔴 Passive command

A command to run to assume a `passive` (non-voting) - a.k.a _Seppukku_. This is simply a reference to an **idempotent** user-supplied command that ensures the validator is set to `passive`. A validator that detects itself as disconnected from the Solana network will call this command to ensure it is `passive`. See [example-scripts/ha-set-role.sh](example-scripts/ha-set-role.sh) for inspiration on a script that handles role transitions. Operators may find it safest to configure validators to **always** start with a `passive` identity so that this command simply restarts the validator service and waits for it to report healthy. Something along the lines of:

   ```yaml
      #...
      failover:
       passive:
         # ⚠️ Everyone's setup is different, but this command should make damn sure 
         # ⚠️ the validator goes passive.
         # ⚠️ If set-identity fails, restart/stop the validator service, 
         # ⚠️ or pull the plug, or call your mum crying for help.
         # ⚠️ All best are off, do **WHATEVER** is necessary to ensure this validator 
         # ⚠️ doesn't come back as active
         command: "seppukku.sh" # user-supplied command
         args: [
           "--passive-identity-file", "{{ .PassiveIdentityKeypairFile }}",
         ]
      #...
   ```

Note that `post-passive` hooks depend on the passive command succeeding to safeguard against false-positives.

## Development and testing

```bash
make dev
make test
```

## Monitoring & Metrics

The application exposes Prometheus metrics on the configured port (default: 9090) and a health check endpoint on a separate configurable port (default: 9091):

### Core Metrics
- **`solana_validator_ha_metadata`**: Validator metadata with role and status labels
- **`solana_validator_ha_peer_count`**: Number of peers visible in gossip
- **`solana_validator_ha_self_in_gossip`**: Whether this validator appears in gossip (1=yes, 0=no)
- **`solana_validator_ha_failover_status`**: Current failover status

### Metric Labels
- `validator_name`: Configured validator name
- `public_ip`: Validator's public IP address
- `validator_role`: Current role (active/passive/unknown)
- `validator_status`: Health status (healthy/unhealthy)
- Plus any configured static labels

### Health Endpoints
- **`/metrics`**: Prometheus metrics (on `prometheus.port`, default: 9090)
- **`/health`**: Basic health check (on `prometheus.health_check_port`, default: 9091)
